# DofusTranslate ðŸŽ®
#### Description
An easy to use translation tool for the popular French MMORPG Game Dofus. DofusTranslate is a computer application which allows users to easily translate the Dofus Chat to their desired language, as well as to write translated text which is automatically copied to the Dofus chat.

#### Features
- **Read Mode** - Automatically detects the location of your Dofus chat and translates the text to your desired language.
- **Write Mode** - Allows the user to type in their preferred language and translate the text into their desired language. The text is placed straight into the Dofus Chat.
- **Export** - Saves translated text to your system as a .txt file.
- **Speech To Text** - Allows the user to speak in their preferred language through their default microphone. The text is input into the GUI which can then be translated and placed straight into the Dofus Chat.

#### Rationale
In October 2022, a major update was implemented in Dofus that merged players from different parts of the world onto a single server. Unfortunately, this led to communication challenges among players due to language differences, which has led to a sense of segregation within the community and reduced motivation to play. To address this issue, I developed an application that bridges the communication gap and facilitates seamless interaction among all players.

#### Features In Progress
- Currently, the program only functions correctly on the most common desktop resolutions (eg. 1920x1080, 1366x768, 1440x900, 1280x720, 1600x900). I will be adding compatibility with more resolutions as time goes on.
- Currently the program only functions correctly on Windows 7/8/10/11. I will be adding compatibility with macOS in the future.
- Currently the program only functions correctly in Fullscreen Windowed mode. I will be adding compatibility with Fullscreen mode in the future.

#### How to Use
1. Download the latest release.
2. Unzip the folder using a program such as 7-Zip or Winrar.
3. Open DofusTranslate.exe. If there are prompts, select 'Run anyway'.
4. Open Dofus in Fullscreen Windowed mode. This means you have the 'Minimize', 'Maximize' and 'Close' buttons at the top right hand corner of your Dofus window.
5. If you have a second monitor, move DofusTranslate to your other monitor. Otherwise, ensure the chatbox is visible and that you do not block the chatbox.
6. You should now be able to use all the features of the application.
