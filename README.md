# DofusTranslate ðŸŽ®
#### Description
An easy to use translation tool for the popular French MMORPG Game Dofus. DofusTranslate is a computer application which allows users to easily translate the Dofus Chat to their desired language, as well as to write translated text which is automatically copied to the Dofus chat.

#### Features
- **Read Mode** - Automatically detects the location of your Dofus chat and translates the text to your desired language.
- **Write Mode** - Allows the user to type in their preferred language and translate the text into their desired language. The text is placed straight into the Dofus Chat.
- **Export** - Saves translated text to your system as a .txt file.

#### Rationale
In October 2022, a major update was implemented in Dofus that merged players from different parts of the world onto a single server. Unfortunately, this led to communication challenges among players due to language differences, which has led to a sense of segregation within the community and reduced motivation to play. To address this issue, I developed an application that bridges the communication gap and facilitates seamless interaction among all players.

#### Features In Progress
- Currently, the program only functions correctly on a 1920x1080 resolution. I am working on making this functional for all popular resolutions.
- An installation guide
